## üîë API Key Configuration

This extension requires a Google Cloud Project with the Gemini API enabled and a corresponding API key.

1.  **Create a Google Cloud Project:** If you don't have one already, create a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2.  **Enable the Gemini API:**
    * Navigate to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) in your project.
    * Search for "Generative Language API" (or similar, depending on the specific Gemini API being used).
    * Enable the API.

3.  **Create API Credentials:**
    * Go to the [Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) in your project.
    * Click "Create credentials" and select "API key".
    * **Important Security Note:** For a public repository, you should **NOT** hardcode your API key directly into the extension's code. Instead, implement a secure method for users to provide their own API key. This could involve:
        * **Storing in Chrome's `sync` or `local` storage:** Prompt the user to enter their API key the first time they use the extension and store it securely in their browser's storage.
        * **Backend Proxy (Advanced):** For more complex applications, you might consider using a backend proxy to handle API calls, but this is likely overkill for a simple public extension.

4.  **Configure the Extension:**
    * **If using browser storage:** Modify the extension's code (specifically the part that makes the API call) to retrieve the API key from Chrome's storage. You will need to create a UI element (e.g., a settings page within the extension) where users can input their API key.

    **Example (Conceptual - adapt to your actual implementation):**

    In your extension's JavaScript code:

    ```javascript
    // Example using chrome.storage.sync
    chrome.storage.sync.get(['geminiApiKey'], function(result) {
      const apiKey = result.geminiApiKey;
      if (apiKey) {
        // Use the apiKey to make calls to the Gemini API
        console.log("Gemini API Key found:", apiKey);
        // ... your API call logic ...
      } else {
        console.log("Gemini API Key not found. Please configure in settings.");
        // Optionally, display a message to the user to configure the API key.
      }
    });
    ```

    You would also need to implement a settings page (e.g., a popup or an options page) where users can input and save their API key using `chrome.storage.sync.set({'geminiApiKey': userInputValue})`.

    **Remember to guide users in your extension's UI on how to obtain and enter their API key.**
